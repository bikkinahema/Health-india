<p>Using breathing techniques for 5 to 10 minutes a day might help lower blood pressure, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00425.2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;completed at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the University of Arizona.</p>

<p>In their study, researchers instructed participants to complete breathing exercises for 5 to 10 minutes daily using a breathing device. The participants were told to take 30 breaths as the machine provided resistance, so their respiratory muscles worked harder. The trial lasted six weeks.</p>

<p>Within two weeks of using the device, the researchers said they noticed improvements in blood pressure. The only side effects noted were temporary sore muscles and lightheadedness.</p>

<p>By the end of the six weeks, participants had an average decrease of 9mmHg in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/high-systolic-blood-pressure">systolic blood pressure</a>.</p>

<p>“A nine-point decrease in systolic blood pressure is tremendous,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/528492-rigved-vishwas-tadwalkar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Rigved Tadwalkar</a>, a cardiologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, told Healthline. “While we have long known that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breathe-deeper-improve-health-and-posture">deep breathing exercises</a>&nbsp;can contribute to lowering blood pressure, it is surprising to learn of such a vigorous effect when adding resistance.”</p>

<p>Researchers said the results were as effective as taking blood pressure medication and possibly more effective than lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-cutting-1-gram-of-salt-per-day-can-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-stroke">reducing salt in your diet</a>.</p>

<p>“As a reference, exercising is expected to reduce systolic blood pressure by approximately 5 to 8 mmHg,” explained&nbsp;<a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/Jim-Liu-MD-42980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jim Liu</a>, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor of internal medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Sticking to a heart-healthy diet can decrease it by approximately 11 mmHg.”</p>

<p>“Hypertension is classified into different stages, with stage 1 including systolic between 130 to 139 mmHg and stage 2 including [greater than] 140 mmHg systolic,” Liu told Healthline. “Treatment differs depending on the stage. Therefore, a decrease in 9 mmHg may be the difference between having to take versus not taking blood pressure medications.”</p>
